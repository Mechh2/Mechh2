Hello! This is my alt account for Github. I mostly use this for school and travel. I am currently working on a game engine made in python (details to be revealed).

My current projects are:

- NoteWork (Text Editor)
- Acrux (Programming Language)
- Sylvestor (Game)

If you want to reach me for some reason, DM my [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ScribblesINK_)
